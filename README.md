# Riding Through Data: Bike Sharing Analytics Project

This repository showcases a complete data analytics project analyzing **bike sharing demand**, created as part of the **Google Data Analytics Certificate – Course 1: *Foundations: Data, Data, Everywhere***.

## Project Summary

The goal of this project was to explore and understand bike rental patterns using two key approaches:

- **Excel Dashboard** for interactive exploration
- **Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** for deeper insights

---

## Tools & Skills Applied

- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Slicers, Charts)
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Data Cleaning & Wrangling
- Pattern Recognition & Segmentation
- Data Storytelling & Insight Generation

---

## Excel Dashboard Highlights

- Pivot tables to analyze **seasonal and weekday trends**
- Slicers to filter **user types** and **months**
- Line charts showing **temperature vs. ridership**
- Bar charts segmenting **casual vs. registered usage**

---

## Python EDA Highlights

Dataset: [`day.csv`](https://lnkd.in/dp5f3AyV) from the UCI Bike Sharing dataset.

Key steps:
- Cleaned and transformed columns (`dteday`, `season`, `weathersit`, etc.)
- Created visualizations with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Analyzed trends in:
  - **Time (season, month, weekday)**
  - **Temperature and Weather Impact**
  - **Casual vs. Registered User Behavior**

---

## Key Insights

✅ Rentals peak during weekdays — indicating **commuting behavior**  
✅ **Fall and summer** months see the highest bike usage  
✅ **Humidity, windspeed, and bad weather** lower ridership  
✅ **Casual users ride more on weekends**; **registered users dominate weekdays**
